 * both entry points behave identically from the user's perspective.
 *
 * Why this is a module helper rather than a store action: the behavior is
 * intrinsically UI-shaped — it shows sonner toasts, registers action/cancel
 * handlers, and depends on `activateAndRevealWorktree` (a renderer-only
 * helper). Keeping it in the renderer layer avoids bleeding toast/UI
 * concerns into the store slice while still preventing the two delete
 * entry points from drifting apart.
