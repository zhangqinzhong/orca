# React Performance Audit

Status: in progress
Started: 2026-05-29
Base commit: `b7fe967780` (`origin/main`, release v1.4.35)

## Goal

Scan the full React surface for `$perf` and `$react-useeffect` issues, keep coverage evidence here, and land the fixes as many small PRs with explicit merge-risk notes.

This document is the audit ledger. A section is not considered fully scanned until it has:

1. File inventory checked from the current worktree.
2. `useEffect` / `useLayoutEffect` / `useInsertionEffect` sites classified.
3. Perf-sensitive patterns checked: timers, subscriptions, observers, `JSON.stringify`, storage writes, polling, broad store subscriptions, large list rendering, and render-time derived state.
4. Each suspicious site dispositioned as "no change", "needs PR", or "covered by PR".
5. Merge risk recorded for every PR candidate.

## Scope

React hook call scan uses all repo `*.ts` and `*.tsx` files, then narrows to actual AST hook calls. The React Effect surface found on 2026-05-29 is:

- `src/renderer/src/**`
- `mobile/app/**`
- `mobile/src/**`
- `mobile/packages/expo-two-way-audio/src/hooks.ts`

Comment-only mentions outside those paths were ignored.

Initial inventory:

## Coverage Ledger

Current count after low-risk PRs #3038, #3041, #3042, #3044, #3051, #3052, #3053, #3054, #3055, #3056, #3058, #3059, #3060, #3062, #3063, #3064, #3065, #3066, #3067, #3068, #3069, #3083, and #3087: 933 Effect hook call sites.

Open medium-risk PRs #3070, #3073, #3077, and #3089 each project to 932 Effect hook call sites on the current merged baseline; open medium-risk PR #3079 projects to 923; open high-risk PR #3075 projects to 929; and open high-risk PR #3081 projects to 925. These are not counted in the merged baseline until reviewed and merged.
